## � Future Roadmap (Recommendations)
Here are some features that could take SquadSync to the next level:

1.  **🤖 AI Itinerary Generator**  
    *   *Idea*: Use Gemini API to generate daily itineraries based on the group's destination and dates.
    *   *Why*: Fills the gap between "planning dates" and "tracking expenses".

2.  **� Real-time Trip Chat**  
    *   *Idea*: A dedicated chat room for each trip so you don't have to switch to WhatsApp.
    *   *Why*: Keeps context (e.g., discussing a specific expense) in one place.

3.  **🗳️ Polls for Decision Making**  
    *   *Idea*: Simple voting for "Where to eat?" or "Which Airbnb?".
    *   *Why*: Faster consensus than endless chat debates.

4.  **🧾 AI Receipt Scanning**  
    *   *Idea*: Upload a photo of a bill, and OCR extracts the items and prices.
    *   *Why*: Reduces manual entry friction for long restaurant bills.

5.  **📍 Map Integration**  
    *   *Idea*: Pin locations (Hotel, Spots) on a shared map.
    *   *Why*: Visualizes the trip logistics.
